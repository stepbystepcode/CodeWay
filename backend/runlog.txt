          "content": "(api-compatibility)=\n\n# API compatibility\n\n<!--* freshness: { reviewed: '2023-07-18' } *-->\n\nJAX is constantly evolving, and we want to be able to make improvements to its\nAPIs. That said, we want to minimize 
      churn for the JAX user community, and we\ntry to make breaking changes rarely.\n\n## JAX Versioning\nJAX uses [Effort-based versioning](https://jacobtomlinson.dev/effver/) (see\n{ref}`jep-effver`), and is currently in the Zero      
      version phase.\nThis means that for version `0.X.Y`, incrementing `Y` will introduce minor\nbreaking changes, and incrementing `X` will introduce major breaking changes.\n\nFor any breaking change, JAX currently follows a 3 month   
      deprecation policy.\nWhen an incompatible change is made to an API, we will make our best effort\nto obey the following procedure:\n* the change will be announced in `CHANGELOG.md` and in the doc string for the\n  deprecated API,   
      and the old API will issue a `DeprecationWarning`.\n* three months after the `jax` release that deprecated an API, we may remove the\n  deprecated API at any time. Note that three months is a *lower* bound, and is\n  intentionally  
      chosen to be faster than that of many more mature projects. In\n  practice, deprecations may take considerably longer, particularly if there are\n  many users of a feature. If a three month deprecation period becomes\n  problematic,
      please raise this with us.\n\nWe reserve the right to change this policy at any time.\n\n## What is covered?\n\nOnly public JAX APIs are covered, which includes the following modules:\n\n* `jax`\n* `jax.dlpack`\n* `jax.image`\n*    
      `jax.lax`\n* `jax.nn`\n* `jax.numpy`\n* `jax.ops`\n* `jax.profiler`\n* `jax.random` (see [details below](#numerics-and-randomness))\n* `jax.scipy`\n* `jax.tree`\n* `jax.tree_util`\n* `jax.test_util`\n\nNot everything in these       
      modules is intended to be public, and over time, we\nare working to separate public and private APIs. Public APIs are documented\nin the JAX documentation.\nAdditionally, our goal is that all non-public APIs should have             
      names\nprefixed with underscores, although we do not entirely comply with this yet.\n\n## What is not covered?\n\n### Explicitly private APIs\nAny API or import path prefixed with an underscore is explicitly private,\nand may change
      without warning between JAX releases. We are working to move\nall private APIs into `jax._src` to make these expectations more clear.\n\n### Legacy internal APIs\nIn addition, there are several legacy modules that currently expose  
      some\nprivate APIs without an underscore, including:\n\n- `jax.core`\n- `jax.interpreters`\n- `jax.lib`\n- `jax.util`\n\nWe are actively working on deprecating these modules and the APIs they contain.\nIn most cases, such           
      deprecations will follow the 3 month deprecation period,\nbut this may not always be possible. If you use any such APIs, please expect\nthem to be deprecated soon, and seek alternatives.\n\n### Experimental and example              
      libraries\nThe following modules include code for experimental or demonstration purposes,\nand API may change between releases without warning:\n\n* `jax.experimental`\n* `jax.example_libraries`\n\nWe understand that some users     
      depend on `jax.experimental`, and so in most cases\nwe follow the 3 month deprecation period for changes, but this may not always be\npossible.\n\n### JAX extend\nThe {mod}`jax.extend` module includes semi-public JAX internal APIs  
      that are\nmeant for use by downstream projects, but do not have the same stability\nguarantees of the main JAX package. If you have code that uses `jax.extend`,\nwe would strongly recommend CI tests against JAX's nightly releases,  
      so as to\ncatch potential changes before they are released.\n\nFor details on `jax.extend`, see the [`jax.extend` module docuementation](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.extend.html), or the design document,                       
      {ref}`jax-extend-jep`.\n\n## Numerics and randomness\n\nThe *exact* values of numerical operations are not guaranteed to be\nstable across JAX releases. In fact, exact numerics are not\nnecessarily stable at a given JAX version,    
      across accelerator\nplatforms, within or without `jax.jit`, and more.\n\nFor a fixed PRNG key input, the outputs of pseudorandom functions in\n`jax.random` may vary across JAX versions. The compatibility policy\napplies only to the 
      output *distribution*. For example, the expression\n`jax.random.gumbel(jax.random.key(72))` may return a different value\nacross JAX releases, but `jax.random.gumbel` will remain a\npseudorandom generator for the Gumbel             
      distribution.\n\nWe try to make such changes to pseudorandom values infrequently. When\nthey happen, the changes are announced in the changelog, but do not\nfollow a deprecation cycle. In some situations, JAX might expose           
      a\ntransient configuration flag that reverts the new behavior, to help\nusers diagnose and update affected code. Such flags will last a\ndeprecation window's amount of time.\n"

          "content": "# Building on JAX\n\n<!--* freshness: { reviewed: '2024-05-03' } *-->\n\nA great way to learn advanced JAX usage is to see how other libraries are using JAX,\nboth how they integrate the library into their API,\nwhat
      functionality it adds mathematically,\nand how it's used for computational speedup in other libraries.\n\n\nBelow are examples of how JAX's features can be used to define accelerated\ncomputation across numerous domains and software
      packages.\n\n## Gradient computation\nEasy gradient calculation is a key feature of JAX.\nIn the [JaxOpt library](https://github.com/google/jaxopt) value and grad is directly utilized for users in multiple optimization algorithms in
      [its source code](https://github.com/google/jaxopt/blob/main/jaxopt/_src/base.py#LL87C30-L87C44).\n\nSimilarly the same Dynamax Optax pairing mentioned above is an example of\ngradients enabling estimation methods that were         
      challenging historically\n[Maximum Likelihood Expectation using Optax](https://probml.github.io/dynamax/notebooks/linear_gaussian_ssm/lgssm_learning.html).\n\n## Computational speedup on a single core across multiple devices\nModels
      defined in JAX can then be compiled to enable single computation speedup through JIT compiling.\nThe same compiled code can then be sent to a CPU device,\nto a GPU or TPU device for additional speedup,\ntypically with no additional 
      changes needed.\nThis allows for a smooth workflow from development into production.\nIn Dynamax the computationally expensive portion of a Linear State Space Model solver has been                                                    
      [jitted](https://github.com/probml/dynamax/blob/main/dynamax/linear_gaussian_ssm/models.py#L579).\nA more complex example comes from PyTensor which compiles a JAX function dynamically and then [jits the constructed                  
      function](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pytensor/blob/main/pytensor/link/jax/linker.py#L64).\n\n## Single and multi computer speedup using parallelization\nAnother benefit of JAX is the simplicity of parallelizing computation        
      using\n`pmap` and `vmap` function calls or decorators.\nIn Dynamax state space models are parallelized with a [VMAP decorator](https://github.com/probml/dynamax/blob/main/dynamax/linear_gaussian_ssm/parallel_inference.py#L89)\na    
      practical example of this use case being multi object tracking.\n\n## Incorporating JAX code into your, or your users, workflows\nJAX is quite composable and can be used in multiple ways.\nJAX can be used with a standalone pattern, 
      where the user defines all the calculations themselves.\nHowever other patterns, such as using libraries built on jax that provide specific functionality.\nThese can be libraries that define specific types of models,\nsuch as Neural
      Networks or State Space models or others,\nor provide specific functionality such as optimization.\nHere are more specific examples of each pattern.\n\n### Direct usage\nJax can be directly imported and utilized to build models     
      \u201cfrom scratch\u201d as shown across this website,\nfor example in [JAX Tutorials](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/tutorials.html)\nor [Neural Network with                                                                          
      JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/neural_network_with_tfds_data.html).\nThis may be the best option if you are unable to find prebuilt code\nfor your particular challenge, or if you're looking to reduce the number\nof   
      dependencies in your codebase.\n\n### Composable domain specific libraries with JAX exposed\nAnother common approach are packages that provide prebuilt functionality,\nwhether it be model definition, or computation of some          
      type.\nCombinations of these packages can then be mixed and matched for a full\nend to end workflow where a model is defined and its parameters are estimated.\n\nOne example is [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax) which simplifies
      the construction of Neural Networks.\nFlax is then typically paired with [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax)\nwhere Flax defines the neural network architecture\nand Optax supplies the optimization & model-fitting            
      capabilities.\n\nAnother is [Dynamax](https://github.com/probml/dynamax) which allows easy\ndefinition of state space models.\nWith Dynamax parameters can be estimated using\n[Maximum Likelihood using                                
      Optax](https://probml.github.io/dynamax/notebooks/linear_gaussian_ssm/lgssm_learning.html)\nor full Bayesian Posterior can be estimating using [MCMC from                                                                               
      Blackjax](https://probml.github.io/dynamax/notebooks/linear_gaussian_ssm/lgssm_hmc.html)\n\n### JAX totally hidden from users\nOther libraries opt to completely wrap JAX in their model specific API.\nAn example is PyMC and          
      [Pytensor](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pytensor),\nin which a user may never \u201csee\u201d JAX directly\nbut instead wrapping [JAX functions](https://pytensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/creating_a_numba_jax_op.html)\nwith
      a PyMC specific API.\n"

      0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/).\n\nFor Python version support, we have heard from users that a 36-month support window can\nbe too short, for example due to the delays in propagation of new CPython releases\nto  
      Linux vendor releases. For this reason JAX supports Python versions for at least\nnine months longer than SPEC-0 recommends.\n\nThis means we support at least:\n\n* All Python feature releases in the 45 months prior to each JAX     
      release. For example:\n\n  * **Python 3.10** was released October 2021, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least until **July 2025**.\n  * **Python 3.11** was released October 2022, and will be supported in new JAX        
      releases at least until **July 2026**.\n  * **Python 3.12** was released October 2023, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least until **July 2027**.\n  * **Python 3.13** was released October 2024, and will be supported in 
      new JAX releases at least until **July 2028**.\n\n* All NumPy feature releases in the 24 months prior to each JAX release. For example:\n\n  * **NumPy 1.25** was released June 2023, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least
      until **June 2025**\n  * **NumPy 1.26** was released September 2023, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least until **September 2025**\n  * **NumPy 2.0** was released June 2024, and will be supported in new JAX releases at
      least until **June 2026**\n  * **NumPy 2.1** was released August 2024, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least until **August 2026**\n  * **NumPy 2.2** was released December 2024, and will be supported in new JAX releases
      at least until **December 2026**.\n\n* All SciPy feature releases in the 24 months prior to each JAX release. For example:\n\n  * **Scipy 1.11** was released June 2023, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least until **June
      2025**.\n  * **Scipy 1.12** was released January 2024, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least until **January 2026**.\n  * **Scipy 1.13** was released April 2024, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least until 
      **April 2026**.\n  * **Scipy 1.14** was released June 2024, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least until **June 2026**.\n  * **Scipy 1.15** was released January 2025, and will be supported in new JAX releases at least   
      until **January 2027**.\n\nJAX releases may support older versions of Python, NumPy, and SciPy than strictly required\nby this policy, but support for older versions may be dropped at any time beyond the listed\ndates.\n"
